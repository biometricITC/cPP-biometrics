== Acknowledgements
This collaborative Protection Profile module (PP-Module) was developed by the {iTC-longame} international Technical Community ({iTC-shortname}) with representatives from industry, Government agencies, Common Criteria Test Laboratories, and members of academia.

== Preface

=== Objectives of Document
This document presents the Common Criteria (CC) collaborative PP-Module to express the security functional requirements (SFRs) and security assurance requirements (SARs) for biometric enrolment and verification on the computer. The Evaluation activities that specify the actions the evaluator performs to determine if a product satisfies the SFRs captured within this PP-Module, are described in <<BIOSD>>.

=== Scope of Document
The scope of the PP-Module within the development and evaluation process is described in the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation. In particular, a PP-Module defines the IT security requirements of a generic type of TOE and specifies the functional security measures to be offered by that TOE to meet stated requirements <<CC1>>, Section B.14.

=== Intended Readership
The target audiences of this PP-Module are developers, CC consumers, system integrators, evaluators and schemes. 

Although the PP-Module and Supporting Document <<BIOSD>> may contain minor editorial errors, the PP-Module is recognized as living document and the iTC is dedicated to ongoing updates and revisions. Please report any issues to the {iTC-shortname}.

== PP-Module Introduction

=== PP-Module Reference
- PP-Module Reference: {doctitle}
- PP-Module Version: {revnumber}
- PP-Module Date: {revdate}

=== Base PP identification
Base PP of this PP-Module is identified in the appropriate PP-Configuration documents.

=== TOE Overview
==== TOE main security features
This is a collaborative Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) used to extend a base PP for a computer that implements biometric enrolment and verification to unlock the computer in the locked state using the user’s biometric characteristics. Therefore, the Target of Evaluation (TOE) in this PP-Module is a computer that implements biometric enrolment and verification functionality. However, the term TOE in this document expresses the biometric system that is a part of the TOE environment (i.e. the computer) and implements the biometric enrolment and verification functionality for clearly describing the relation and boundary between the biometric system and computer. The biometric enrolment and verification processes are described in the following sections. 

===== Biometric Enrolment

During the enrolment process, the TOE captures samples from the biometric characteristics of a user presented to the TOE and extracts the features from the samples. The features are then stored as a template in the TOE.

Only a user who knows the computer NBAF can enrol or revoke one's own templates. Multiple templates may be enroled, as separate entries uniquely identified by the TOE, and optionally uniquely identifiable by the user (through the computer's User Interface).

===== Biometric Verification

During the verification process, a user presents one's own biometric characteristics to the TOE without presenting any user identity information for unlocking the computer. The TOE captures samples from the biometric characteristics, retrieves all enroled templates and compares them with the features extracted from the captured samples of the user to measure the similarity between the two data and determines whether to accept or reject the user based on the similarity, and indicates the decision to the computer.

Examples of biometric characteristic used by the TOE are: fingerprint, face, eye, palm print, finger vein, palm vein, speech, signature and so forth. However, scope of this PP-Module is limited to only those biometric characteristics for which <<BIOSD>> defines the Evaluation Activities.

==== TOE Design
The TOE is fully integrated into the computer without the need for additional software and hardware. The following figure, inspired from <<ISO30107-1>>, is a generic representation of a TOE. It should be noted that the actual TOE design may not directly correspond to this figure and the developer may design the TOE in a different way. This illustrates the different sub-functionalities on which the biometric enrolment and verification processes rely on.

[#img-TOE-generic]
.Generic representation of a TOE
image::TOE_flows.jpg[title="Generic representation of a TOE" align="center"]
{empty} +
As illustrated in the above figure, the TOE is capable of:

* Capturing samples from user’s biometric characteristics (Data Capture Subsystem)
* Extracting and processing the features from samples of sufficient quality and generating various templates (Signal Processing Subsystem)
* Storing the templates in a database on the computer (Storage Subsystem)
* Comparing captured features with data contained in one or more templates (Comparison Subsystem)
* Deciding how well features and any template match, and indicating whether or not a verification of the user has been achieved (Decision Subsystem)
* Optionally detecting the presentation attacks using an artefact (Presentation attack detection subsystem)

==== Relation between TOE and Computer 
The TOE is reliant on the computer itself to provide overall security of the system. This PP-Module is intended to be used with a base PP, and the base PP is responsible for evaluating the following security functions:

* Providing the NBAF to support user authentication and management of the TOE security function
* Invoking the TOE to enrol and verify the user and take appropriate actions based on the decision of the TOE
* Providing the Secure Execution Environment that guarantees the TOE and its data to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity

The specification of the above security functions is out of scope of this PP-Module and are part of the base PP.

.Generic relations between the TOE and the computer environment

==== TOE Use Case
The computer itself may be operated in a number of use cases such as enterprise use with limited personal use or Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The TOE on the device may also be operated in the same use cases, however, use cases of the TOE should be devised separately considering the purpose of biometric verification. The following use cases describe how and why biometric verification is supposed to be used. Each use case has its own assurance level, depending on its criticality and separate PP or PP-Module should be developed for each use case.  

This PP-Module only assumes USE CASE 1 described below. USE CASE 2 is out of scope of this PP-Module.

===== USE CASE 1: Biometric verification for unlocking the computer
This use case is applicable for any computers such as a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone that implement biometric enrolment and verification functionality. For enhanced security that is easy to use, the computer may implement biometric verification on a computer once it has been “unlocked”. The initial unlock is generally done by a NBAF which is required at startup (or possibly after some period of time), and after that, the user is able to use one's own biometric characteristic to unlock access to the computer. In this use case, the computer is not supposed to be used for security sensitive services through the biometric verification.

The main concern of this use case is the accuracy of the biometric verification (i.e. FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR). Security assurance for computer that the TOE relies on should be handled by the base PP.

This use case assumes that the computer is configured correctly to enable the biometric verification by the user, who acts as the biometric system administrator in this use case.

It is also assumed that the user enrols to the biometric system correctly, following the guidance provided by the TOE. Presentation attacks during biometric enrolment and verification may be out of scope, but optionally addressed. FTE is not a security relevant criterion for this use case.

===== USE CASE 2: Biometric verification for security sensitive service

This use case is an example of another use case that is not considered in this PP-Module. Another PP or PP-Module should be developed at higher assurance level for this use case.

Computers may be used for security sensitive services such as payment transactions and online banking. Verification may be done by the biometric for convenience instead of the NBAF to access such security sensitive services.

The requirements for the TOE focus on the biometric performance (FTE, FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR) and presentation attack detection.

== Consistency rationale

Consistency between the base PP and this PP-Module is demonstrated in the appropriate PP-Configuration.

== Conformance Claims

=== Conformance statement

As defined by the references <<CC1>>, <<CC2>> and <<CC3>>, this PP-Module:

* conforms to the requirements of Common Criteria v3.1, Revision 5,
* is Part 2 extended,
* all assurance requirements are inherited from the base PP,
* does not claim conformance to any other security functional packages.

=== Evaluation activities

This PP-Module requires the use of evaluation activities defined in <<BIOSD>>.

== Security Problem Definition

The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address, assumptions about its operational environment, and any organizational security policies that the TOE is expected to enforce.

This PP-Module is written to address the situation described in the section <<USE CASE 1: Biometric verification for unlocking the computer>>. 

Note that as a PP-Module, all threats, assumptions, and OSPs defined in the base PP will also apply to a TOE unless otherwise specified. The SFRs defined in this PP-Module will mitigate the threats that are defined in the PP-Module but may also mitigate some threats defined in the base PP in more comprehensive detail due to the specific capabilities provided by a biometric system.

=== Threats

[[T.Casual_Attack]]T.Casual_Attack::
An attacker may attempt to impersonate as a legitimate user without being enroled in the TOE. In order to perform the attack, the attacker only use one's own biometric characteristic (in form of a zero-effort impostor attempt).

=== Organizational Security Policies

[[OSP.Enrol]]OSP.Enrol::
The TOE shall enrol a user for biometric verification, only after successful authentication of a user. The TOE shall ensure that templates are of sufficient quality in order to meet the relevant error rates for biometric verification.

[[OSP.Protection]]OSP.Protection::
The TOE in cooperation with its environment shall protect itself, its configuration and biometric data.

[[OSP.Verification_Error]]OSP.Verification_Error::
The TOE shall meet relevant criteria for its security relevant error rates for biometric verification.

=== Assumptions
This PP-Module does not define any assumptions.
 
== Security Objectives 
This PP-Module defines the following security objectives.

=== Security Objectives for the TOE

[[O.BIO_Verification]]O.BIO_Verification::
The TOE shall provide a biometric verification mechanism to verify a user with an adequate reliability. The TOE shall meet the relevant criteria for its security relevant error rates for biometric verification.

SFR Rationale:

Requirements to provide a biometric verification mechanism are defined in FIA_MBV_EXT.1 in which ST author can specify the relevant criteria for its security relevant error rates. FIA_MBV_EXT.2 requires the TOE to only use samples of sufficient quality to verify a user with an adequate reliability.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: In this PP-Module, relevant criteria are FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR and corresponding error rates shall be specified in the FIA_MBV_EXT.1.

[[O.Enrol]]O.Enrol::
The TOE shall implement the functionality to enrol a user for biometric verification and bind the template to the user only after successful authentication of the user to the TOE environment using an alternative authentication mechanism. The TOE shall create the sufficient quality of templates in order to meet the relevant error rates for biometric verification.

SFR Rationale:

Requirements to provide a biometric enrolment mechanism are defined in FIA_MBE_EXT.1. Requirements for quality of template are defined in FIA_MBE_EXT.2.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: A user shall be authenticated using a NBAF to enrol to the biometric system.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: In this PP-Module, relevant criteria are FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR and corresponding error rates shall be specified in the FIA_MBV_EXT.1.

[[O.Protection]]O.Protection::
The TOE shall protect biometric data using the Secure Execution Environment provided by the TOE environment during runtime and storage.

SFR Rationale:

Requirements to control access to the template defined in FPT_PBT_EXT.1. FPT_BDP_EXT.1, FPT_BDP_EXT.2 and FPT_BDP_EXT.3 require the TOE to protect the biometric data with support from the TOE environment. Optional requirements to protect the residual biometric data are defined as FDP_RIP.2 in <<Optional Requirements>>.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The TOE and TOE environment (i.e. the computer) shall satisfy relevant requirements defined in this PP-Module and base PP respectively to protect biometric data.

=== Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

[[OE.Protection]]OE.Protection::
The TOE environment shall provide a Secure Execution Environment to protect the TOE, the TOE configuration and biometric data during runtime and storage.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The TOE and TOE environment (i.e. the computer) shall satisfy relevant requirements defined in this PP-Module and base PP respectively to protect biometric data.

=== Security Objectives Rationale
The following table describes how the assumptions, threats, and organizational security policies map to the security objectives.

.Mapping between Security Problem Definition and Security Objectives
|===
|Threat, Assumption, or OSP 
|Security Objectives 
|Rationale

|<<T.Casual_Attack>> <<OSP.Verification_Error>>	
|<<O.BIO_Verification>>	
|The threat <<T.Casual_Attack>> is countered by <<O.BIO_Verification>> as this provides the capability of biometric verification to disallow an unenroled user from impersonating a legitimate user. The OSP <<OSP.Verification_Error>> is enforced by <<O.BIO_Verification>> as this requires the TOE to meet relevant criteria for security relevant error rates for biometric verification.

|<<OSP.Enrol>>	
|<<O.Enrol>>	
|The OSP <<OSP.Enrol>> is enforced by <<O.Enrol>> as this require the TOE to implement the functionality to enrol a user for biometric verification and create sufficient quality of templates.

|<<OSP.Protection>>	
|<<O.Protection>> <<OE.Protection>>	
|The OSP <<OSP.Protection>> is enforced by <<O.Protection>> and its operational environment objective <<OE.Protection>>.

== Security Functional Requirements

=== Conventions
The individual security functional requirements are specified in the sections below.
The following conventions are used for the completion of operations:

* [_Italicized text within square brackets_] indicates an operation to be completed by the ST author.

* [*Bold text within square brackets*] indicates the type of operation.

Extended SFRs are identified by having a label “EXT” at the end of the SFR name.

=== Identification and Authentication (FIA)

==== FIA_MBE_EXT.1 Biometric enrolment [[FIA_MBE_EXT.1]]

*FIA_MBE_EXT.1.1*:: The TSF shall provide a mechanism to enrol an authenticated user.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: User shall be authenticated by the computer using the NBAF before beginning biometric enrolment.

==== FIA_MBE_EXT.2 Quality of biometric templates for biometric enrolment [[FIA_MBE_EXT.2]]

*FIA_MBE_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall create templates of sufficient quality.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: ST author may refine “sufficient quality” to specify quality standards if the TOE follows such standard.

==== FIA_MBV_EXT.1 Biometric verification [[FIA_MBV_EXT.1]]

*FIA_MBV_EXT.1.1*:: The TSF shall provide a biometric verification mechanism using [*selection*: _fingerprint, eye, face, voice, vein_, [*assignment*: _other modality_]].

*FIA_MBV_EXT.1.2*:: The TSF shall provide a biometric verification mechanism with the [*selection*: _FMR, FAR_] not exceeding [*assignment*: _defined value_] and [*selection*: _FNMR, FRR_] not exceeding [*assignment*: _defined value_].

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: If the TOE supports multiple modalities, the ST author may iterate the SFR to define different error rates for each modality.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: ST author shall select or assign those modalities in FIA_MBV_EXT.1.1 for which <<BIOSD>> defines the Evaluation Activities.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: While the value of FMR, FAR, FNMR and FRR shall be assigned by the ST author, the ST author should consider the following factors for setting those values.
+
[loweralpha]
. Allowed maximum values defined in the standards
+
For example, <<NIST800-63B>> requires that FMR shall be 1 in 1000 or lower. <<ISO29156,ISO/IEC 29156>> suggests as a simple rule of thumb that for basic, medium and high levels of authentication assurance, rates of 1% (1 in 100), 0.01% (1 in 10^4^) and 0.0001% (1 in 10^6^) can be considered as suitable target figures for FAR. Several mobile vendors have specified that fingerprint verification shall have the FAR lower than 0.002% and recommended to have the FRR lower than 10%. While the PP-Module does not provide any recommendation for those error rates, the ST author should set appropriate error rates referring those values. 
+
For consistency in language throughout this document, referring to a “lower” number will mean the chance of occurrence is lower (i.e. 1/100 is lower than 1/20). So, saying device 1 has a lower FAR than device 2 means device 1 could have 1/1000 and device 2 would be 1/999 or higher in terms of likelihood. Saying “greater” will explicitly mean the opposite.

. Technical limitation
+
Although different modalities are available for the biometric verification, all modalities may not achieve the same level of accuracy. For modalities that have different target of error rates, the ST author may iterate the requirement to set appropriate error rates for each modality.

. Number of test subjects required for the performance testing
+
Target error rates defined in SFR shall be evaluated based on <<BIOSD>>. Normally the target error rates will directly influence the size of the test subjects, the time and cost of the testing. <<BIOSD>> describes how those error rates should be evaluated in an objective manner.

==== FIA_MBV_EXT.2 Quality of biometric samples for biometric verification [[FIA_MBV_EXT.2]]

*FIA_MBV_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall only use samples of sufficient quality to verify the user.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: ST author may refine “sufficient quality” to specify quality standards if the TOE follows such standard.

=== Protection of the TSF (FPT)
==== FPT_BDP_EXT.1 Biometric data processing [[FPT_BDP_EXT.1]]

*FPT_BDP_EXT.1.1* The TSF shall process any plaintext biometric data used to generate templates and perform sample matching within the security boundary of the Secure Execution Environment.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The Consistency Rationale in the appropriate PP-Configuration explains how the TOE in cooperation with its environment shall protect biometric data in detail.

==== FPT_BDP_EXT.2 Biometric data transmission [[FPT_BDP_EXT.2]]

*FPT_BDP_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall not transmit any plaintext biometric data outside the security boundary of the Secure Execution Environment.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The Consistency Rationale in the appropriate PP-Configuration explains how the TOE in cooperation with its environment shall protect biometric data in detail.

==== FPT_BDP_EXT.3 Biometric data storage [[FPT_BDP_EXT.3]]

[[FPT_BDP_EXT.3.1]]*FPT_BDP_EXT.3.1* The TSF shall not store any plaintext biometric data outside the security boundary of the Secure Execution Environment.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The Consistency Rationale in the appropriate PP-Configuration explains how the TOE in cooperation with its environment shall protect biometric data in detail.

==== FPT_PBT_EXT.1 Protection of biometric template [[FPT_PBT_EXT.1]]

*FPT_PBT_EXT.1.1*:: The TSF shall protect the template [*selection*: _using a PIN as an additional factor, using a password as an additional factor_, [*assignment*: _other circumstances_]].

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The Consistency Rationale in the appropriate PP-Configuration explains how the TOE in cooperation with its environment shall protect biometric data in detail.

== Security Assurance Requirements

This PP-Module does not define any additional assurance requirements above and beyond what is defined in the base PP that it extends. Application of the SARs to the TOE boundary described by both the claimed base and this PP-Module is sufficient to demonstrate that the claimed SFRs have been implemented correctly by the TOE.

== Selection-Based Requirements

As indicated in the introduction to this PP-Module, the baseline requirements (those that shall be performed by the TOE) are contained in <<Security Functional Requirements>>. Additionally, there are two other types of requirements specified in <<Selection-Based Requirements>> and <<Optional Requirements>>.

This section comprises requirements based on selections in other SFRs from the PP-Module: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in this Section will need to be included in the body of the ST.

The PP-Module does not contain any selection-based requirements.

== Optional Requirements
This section comprises requirements that can be included in the ST, but are not mandatory for a TOE to claim conformance to this PP-Module.

ST authors are free to choose none, some or all SFRs defined in this Section. Just the fact that a product supports a certain functionality does not mandate to add any SFR defined in this chapter.

=== Identification and Authentication (FIA)

==== FIA_MBE_EXT.3 Presentation attack detection for biometric enrolment [[FIA_MBE_EXT.3]]

*FIA_MBE_EXT.3.1* The TSF shall prevent use of artificial presentation attack instruments from being successfully enroled.

==== FIA_MBV_EXT.3 Presentation attack detection for biometric verification [[FIA_MBV_EXT.3]]

*FIA_MBV_EXT.3.1* The TSF shall prevent use of artificial presentation attack instruments from being successfully verified.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: Artefacts that the TOE shall prevent and relevant criteria for its security relevant error rates for each type of artefact is defined in <<BIOSD>>.

=== User data protection (FDP)

==== FDP_RIP.2 Full residual information protection [[FDP_RIP.2]]

*FDP_RIP.2.1* The TSF shall ensure that any previous information content of biometric data is made unavailable upon the [*selection*: _allocation of the resource to, deallocation of the resource from_] all objects.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The Consistency Rationale in the appropriate PP-Configuration explains how the TOE in cooperation with its environment shall protect biometric data in detail.

== Extended Component Definitions

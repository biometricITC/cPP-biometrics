== Preface

=== Objectives of Document
This document presents the Common Criteria (CC) collaborative PP-Module to express the security functional requirements (SFRs) and security assurance requirements (SARs) for biometric enrolment and verification on the computer. The Evaluation activities that specify the actions the evaluator performs to determine if a product satisfies the SFRs captured within this PP-Module, are described in <<BIOSD>>.

=== Scope of Document
The scope of the PP-Module within the development and evaluation process is described in the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation. In particular, a PP-Module defines the IT security requirements of a generic type of TOE and specifies the functional security measures to be offered by that TOE to meet stated requirements <<CC1>>, Section B.14.

=== Intended Readership
The target audiences of this PP-Module are developers, CC consumers, system integrators, evaluators and schemes. 

Although the PP-Module and Supporting Document <<BIOSD>> may contain minor editorial errors, the PP-Module is recognized as living document and the iTC is dedicated to ongoing updates and revisions. Please report any issues to the {iTC-shortname}.

== PP-Module Introduction

=== PP-Module Reference
- PP-Module Reference: {doctitle}
- PP-Module Version: {revnumber}
- PP-Module Date: {revdate}

=== Base PP identification
This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals <<PP_MD_V3.3>>.

This Base-PP is valid because biometric enrolment and verification may be a specific type of stand-alone software application or a built-in component of a computer. The biometric enrolment and verification functionality defined by this PP-Module will rely on the Base-PP. The biometric enrolment and verification functionality defined by this PP-Module will rely on the Base-PP and Section <<PP_MD_V3.3 Security Functional Requirements Direction>> of this PP-Module describes the relevant functionality for the Base-PP, including specific selections, assignments, or inclusion of optional requirements that must be made as needed to support the biometric enrolment and verification functionality.

=== TOE Overview
==== TOE main security features
This is a collaborative Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) used to extend a base PP for a computer that implements biometric enrolment and verification to unlock the computer in the locked state using the user’s biometric characteristics. Therefore, the Target of Evaluation (TOE) in this PP-Module is a computer that implements biometric enrolment and verification functionality. However, the term TOE in this document expresses the biometric system that is a part of the TOE environment (i.e. the computer) and implements the biometric enrolment and verification functionality for clearly describing the relation and boundary between the biometric system and computer. The biometric enrolment and verification processes are described in the following sections. 

===== Biometric Enrolment

During the enrolment process, the TOE captures samples from the biometric characteristics of a user presented to the TOE and extracts the features from the samples. The features are then stored as a template in the TOE.

Only a user who knows the computer NBAF can enrol or revoke one's own templates. Multiple templates may be enroled, as separate entries uniquely identified by the TOE, and optionally uniquely identifiable by the user (through the computer's User Interface).

===== Biometric Verification

During the verification process, a user presents one's own biometric characteristics to the TOE without presenting any user identity information for unlocking the computer. The TOE captures samples from the biometric characteristics, retrieves all enroled templates and compares them with the features extracted from the captured samples of the user to measure the similarity between the two data and determines whether to accept or reject the user based on the similarity, and indicates the decision to the computer.

Examples of biometric characteristic used by the TOE are: fingerprint, face, eye, palm print, finger vein, palm vein, speech, signature and so forth. However, scope of this PP-Module is limited to only those biometric characteristics for which <<BIOSD>> defines the Evaluation Activities.

==== TOE Design
The TOE is fully integrated into the computer without the need for additional software and hardware. The following figure, inspired from <<ISO30107-1>>, is a generic representation of a TOE. It should be noted that the actual TOE design may not directly correspond to this figure and the developer may design the TOE in a different way. This illustrates the different sub-functionalities on which the biometric enrolment and verification processes rely on.

[#img-TOE-generic]
.Generic representation of a TOE
image::TOE_flows.jpg[title="Generic representation of a TOE" align="center"]
{empty} +
As illustrated in the above figure, the TOE is capable of:

* Capturing samples from user’s biometric characteristics (Data Capture Subsystem)
* Extracting and processing the features from samples of sufficient quality and generating various templates (Signal Processing Subsystem)
* Storing the templates in a database on the computer (Storage Subsystem)
* Comparing captured features with data contained in one or more templates (Comparison Subsystem)
* Deciding how well features and any template match, and indicating whether or not a verification of the user has been achieved (Decision Subsystem)
* Optionally detecting the presentation attacks using an artefact (Presentation attack detection subsystem)

==== Relation between TOE and Computer 
The TOE is reliant on the computer itself to provide overall security of the system. This PP-Module is intended to be used with a base PP, and the base PP is responsible for evaluating the following security functions:

* Providing the NBAF to support user authentication and management of the TOE security function
* Invoking the TOE to enrol and verify the user and take appropriate actions based on the decision of the TOE
* Providing the Separate Execution Environment that guarantees the TOE and its data to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity

The specification of the above security functions is out of scope of this PP-Module and are part of the base PP.

.Generic relations between the TOE and the computer environment

==== TOE Use Case
The computer itself may be operated in a number of use cases such as enterprise use with limited personal use or Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The TOE on the device may also be operated in the same use cases, however, use cases of the TOE should be devised separately considering the purpose of biometric verification. The following use cases describe how and why biometric verification is supposed to be used. Each use case has its own assurance level, depending on its criticality and separate PP or PP-Module should be developed for each use case.  

This PP-Module only assumes USE CASE 1 described below. USE CASE 2 is out of scope of this PP-Module.

===== USE CASE 1: Biometric verification for unlocking the computer
This use case is applicable for any computers such as a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone that implement biometric enrolment and verification functionality. For enhanced security that is easy to use, the computer may implement biometric verification on a computer once it has been “unlocked”. The initial unlock is generally done by a NBAF which is required at startup (or possibly after some period of time), and after that, the user is able to use one's own biometric characteristic to unlock access to the computer. In this use case, the computer is not supposed to be used for security sensitive services through the biometric verification.

The main concern of this use case is the accuracy of the biometric verification (i.e. FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR). Security assurance for computer that the TOE relies on should be handled by the base PP.

This use case assumes that the computer is configured correctly to enable the biometric verification by the user, who acts as the biometric system administrator in this use case.

It is also assumed that the user enrols to the biometric system correctly, following the guidance provided by the TOE. Presentation attacks during biometric enrolment and verification may be out of scope, but optionally addressed. FTE is not a security relevant criterion for this use case.

===== USE CASE 2: Biometric verification for security sensitive service

This use case is an example of another use case that is not considered in this PP-Module. Another PP or PP-Module should be developed at higher assurance level for this use case.

Computers may be used for security sensitive services such as payment transactions and online banking. Verification may be done by the biometric for convenience instead of the NBAF to access such security sensitive services.

The requirements for the TOE focus on the biometric performance (FTE, FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR) and presentation attack detection.

== Conformance Claims

=== Conformance statement

As defined by the references <<CC1>>, <<CC2>> and <<CC3>>, this PP-Module:

* conforms to the requirements of Common Criteria v3.1, Revision 5,
* is Part 2 extended,
* all assurance requirements are inherited from the base PP,
* does not claim conformance to any other security functional packages.

=== Evaluation activities

This PP-Module requires the use of evaluation activities defined in <<BIOSD>>.

== Security Problem Definition

The security problem is described in terms of the threats that the TOE is expected to address, assumptions about its operational environment, and any organizational security policies that the TOE is expected to enforce.

This PP-Module is written to address the situation described in the section <<USE CASE 1: Biometric verification for unlocking the computer>>. 

Note that as a PP-Module, all threats, assumptions, and OSPs defined in the base PP will also apply to a TOE unless otherwise specified. The SFRs defined in this PP-Module will mitigate the threats that are defined in the PP-Module but may also mitigate some threats defined in the base PP in more comprehensive detail due to the specific capabilities provided by a biometric system.

=== Threats

[[T.Casual_Attack]]T.Casual_Attack::
An attacker may attempt to impersonate as a legitimate user without being enroled in the TOE. In order to perform the attack, the attacker only use one's own biometric characteristic (in form of a zero-effort impostor attempt).

=== Organizational Security Policies

[[OSP.Enrol]]OSP.Enrol::
The TOE shall enrol a user for biometric verification, only after successful authentication of a user. The TOE shall ensure that templates are of sufficient quality in order to meet the relevant error rates for biometric verification.

[[OSP.Protection]]OSP.Protection::
The TOE in cooperation with its environment shall protect itself, its configuration and biometric data.

[[OSP.Verification_Error]]OSP.Verification_Error::
The TOE shall meet relevant criteria for its security relevant error rates for biometric verification.

=== Assumptions
This PP-Module does not define any assumptions.
 
== Security Objectives 
This PP-Module defines the following security objectives.

=== Security Objectives for the TOE

[[O.BIO_Verification]]O.BIO_Verification::
The TOE shall provide a biometric verification mechanism to verify a user with an adequate reliability. The TOE shall meet the relevant criteria for its security relevant error rates for biometric verification.

SFR Rationale:

Requirements to provide a biometric verification mechanism are defined in FIA_MBV_EXT.1 in which ST author can specify the relevant criteria for its security relevant error rates. FIA_MBV_EXT.2 requires the TOE to only use samples of sufficient quality to verify a user with an adequate reliability.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: In this PP-Module, relevant criteria are FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR. Corresponding error rates are specified in FIA_MBV_EXT.1.

[[O.Enrol]]O.Enrol::
The TOE shall implement the functionality to enrol a user for biometric verification and bind the template to the user only after successful authentication of the user to the TOE environment using an alternative authentication mechanism. The TOE shall create templates of sufficient quality in order to meet the relevant error rates for biometric verification.

SFR Rationale:

Requirements to provide a biometric enrolment mechanism are defined in FIA_MBE_EXT.1. Requirements for quality of template are defined in FIA_MBE_EXT.2.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: A user enroling to the biometric system will have been authenticated using a NBAF, as specified in FIA_MBE_EXT.1.1.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: In this PP-Module, relevant criteria are FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR. Corresponding error rates are specified in FIA_MBV_EXT.1.

[[O.Protection]]O.Protection::
The TOE shall protect biometric data using the Separate Execution Environment provided by the TOE environment during runtime and storage.

SFR Rationale:

Requirements to control access to the template defined in FPT_PBT_EXT.1. FPT_BDP_EXT.1, FPT_KST_EXT.1 (refined from <<PP_MD_V3.3>>) and FPT_KST_EXT.2 (refined from <<PP_MD_V3.3>>) require the TOE to protect the biometric data with support from the TOE environment. Optional requirements to protect the residual biometric data are defined as FDP_RIP.2 in <<Optional Requirements>>.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The TOE and TOE environment (i.e., the computer) satisfy relevant requirements defined in this PP-Module and base PP respectively to protect biometric data.

=== Security Objectives for the Operational Environment

[[OE.Protection]]OE.Protection::
The TOE environment shall provide a Separate Execution Environment to protect the TOE, the TOE configuration and biometric data during runtime and storage.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The TOE and TOE environment (i.e. the computer) satisfy relevant requirements defined in this PP-Module and base PP respectively to protect biometric data.

=== Security Objectives Rationale
The following table describes how the assumptions, threats, and organizational security policies map to the security objectives.

== Security Functional Requirements

=== Conventions
The individual security functional requirements are specified in the sections below.
The following conventions are used for the completion of operations:

* [_Italicized text within square brackets_] indicates an operation to be completed by the ST author.

* [*Bold text within square brackets*] indicates the type of operation.

Extended SFRs are identified by having a label “EXT” at the end of the SFR name.

=== PP_MD_V3.3 Security Functional Requirements Direction

In a PP-Configuration that includes the <<PP_MD_V3.3>>, the biometric enrolment and verification is expected to rely on some of the security functions implemented by the computer as a whole and evaluated against the Base-PP. In this case, the following sections describe any modifications that the ST author must make to the SFRs defined in the Base-PP in addition to what is mandated by <<TOE Security Functional Requirements>>. 

Full evaluation activities are not repeated in the <<BIOSD>> for the requirements in this section that are references to the <<PP_MD_V3.3>>; only the additional testing needed to supplement what has already been captured in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> is included in the <<BIOSD>>

[NOTE]
====
TODO: Need to add additional EAs for modified and additional SFR to <<BIOSD>>
====

==== Modified SFRs

The SFRs listed in this section are defined in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> and relevant to the secure operation of the biometric enrolment and verification. It is necessary for the ST author to complete selections and/or assignments for these SFRs in a specific manner in order to ensure that the functionality provided by the mobile device is consistent with the functionality required by the biometric enrolment and verification in order for it to conform to this PP-Module.

===== FPT_KST_EXT.1 Key Storage [[FPT_KST_EXT.1]]

*FPT_KST_EXT.1.1*:: The TSF shall not store any plaintext key material *and biometric data* in readable non-volatile memory.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: This SFR is functionally identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> with the addition of biometric data as key materials to be protected. Plaintext biometric data to be protected includes any data used to generate templates or perform sample comparisons from the initial data capture, as well as the comparison score.

===== FPT_KST_EXT.2 No Key Transmission [[FPT_KST_EXT.2]]

*FPT_KST_EXT.2.1*:: The TSF shall not transmit any plaintext key material *or biometric data* outside the security boundary of the TOE.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: This SFR is functionally identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> with the addition of biometric data as plaintext key materials that must not be transmitted off-device.

==== Additional SFRs

This section lists additional SFRs that must be added to the TOE boundary in order to implement the functionality in any PP-Configuration where the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> is claimed as the Base-PP.

[NOTE]
====
TODO: Need to add additonal SFRs here 
====

=== TOE Security Functional Requirements
This section lists SFRs for the biometric enrolment and verification.

==== Identification and Authentication (FIA)

===== FIA_MBE_EXT.1 Biometric enrolment [[FIA_MBE_EXT.1]]

*FIA_MBE_EXT.1.1*:: The TSF shall provide a mechanism to enrol an authenticated user.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: A user enroling to the biometric system will have been authenticated using a NBAF, as specified in FIA_MBE_EXT.1.1.

===== FIA_MBE_EXT.2 Quality of biometric templates for biometric enrolment [[FIA_MBE_EXT.2]]

*FIA_MBE_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall create templates of sufficient quality.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: ST author may refine “sufficient quality” to specify quality standards if the TOE follows such standard.

===== FIA_MBV_EXT.1 Biometric verification [[FIA_MBV_EXT.1]]

*FIA_MBV_EXT.1.1*:: The TSF shall provide a biometric verification mechanism using [*selection*: _fingerprint, eye, face, voice, vein_, [*assignment*: _other modality_]].

*FIA_MBV_EXT.1.2*:: The TSF shall provide a biometric verification mechanism with the [*selection*: _FMR, FAR_] not exceeding [*assignment*: _defined value_] and [*selection*: _FNMR, FRR_] not exceeding [*assignment*: _defined value_].

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: Consider the following factors when setting values of FMR, FAR, FNMR and FRR.
+
[loweralpha]
. Allowed maximum values defined in the standards
+
For example, <<NIST800-63B>> requires that FMR be 1 in 1000 or lower. <<ISO29156,ISO/IEC 29156>> suggests as a simple rule of thumb that for basic, medium and high levels of authentication assurance, rates of 1% (1 in 100), 0.01% (1 in 10^4^) and 0.0001% (1 in 10^6^) can be considered as suitable target figures for FAR. Several mobile vendors have specified that fingerprint verification have the FAR lower than 0.002% and recommended to have the FRR lower than 10%. While the PP-Module does not provide any recommendation for those error rates, the ST author should set appropriate error rates referring those values. 
+
For consistency in language throughout this document, referring to a “lower” number will mean the chance of occurrence is lower (i.e. 1/100 is lower than 1/20). So, saying device 1 has a lower FAR than device 2 means device 1 could have 1/1000 and device 2 would be 1/999 or higher in terms of likelihood. Saying “greater” will explicitly mean the opposite.

. Technical limitation
+
Although different modalities are available for the biometric verification, all modalities may not achieve the same level of accuracy. For modalities that have different target of error rates, the ST author may iterate the requirement to set appropriate error rates for each modality.

. Number of test subjects required for the performance testing
+
Target error rates defined in SFR shall be evaluated based on <<BIOSD>>. Normally the target error rates will directly influence the size of the test subjects, the time and cost of the testing. <<BIOSD>> describes how those error rates should be evaluated in an objective manner.

===== FIA_MBV_EXT.2 Quality of biometric samples for biometric verification [[FIA_MBV_EXT.2]]

*FIA_MBV_EXT.2.1* The TSF shall only use samples of sufficient quality to verify the user.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: ST author may refine “sufficient quality” to specify quality standards if the TOE follows such standard.

==== Protection of the TSF (FPT)
===== FPT_BDP_EXT.1 Biometric data processing [[FPT_BDP_EXT.1]]

*FPT_BDP_EXT.1.1* Processing of plaintext biometric data used to generate templates and perform sample matching shall be hardware-isolated from the OS on the TSF in runtime.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: If biometric data processing occurs in a separate execution environment on the same Application Processor as the OS, the biometric data must be cleared from RAM immediately after use, and at least, must be wiped with the device is locked.

===== FPT_PBT_EXT.1 Protection of biometric template [[FPT_PBT_EXT.1]]

*FPT_PBT_EXT.1.1*:: The TSF shall protect the template [*selection*: _using a PIN as an additional factor, using a password as an additional factor_, [*assignment*: _other circumstances_]].

=== TOE Security Functional Requirements Rationale

The following rationale provides justification for each security objective for the TOE, showing that the SFRs are suitable to meet and achieve the security objectives:

[NOTE]
====
TODO: Need to add table that explain SFR rationals in SPD in more detail here. 
====

== Security Assurance Requirements

This PP-Module does not define any additional assurance requirements above and beyond what is defined in the base PP that it extends. Application of the SARs to the TOE boundary described by both the claimed base and this PP-Module is sufficient to demonstrate that the claimed SFRs have been implemented correctly by the TOE.

== Consistency Rationale

This section describes consistency rationale between <<PP_MD_V3.3>> and this PP-Module to show that the unions of Security Problem Definition, objectives, and Security Functional Requirement(SFR)s defined in <<PP_MD_V3.3>> and this PP-Module do not lead to a contradiction.

=== Consistency of TOE Type

When this PP-Module is used to extend <<PP_MD_V3.3>>, the TOE type for the overall TOE is still a generic mobile device. However, one of the functions of the device must be the ability for it to have biometric enrolment and verification capability. The TOE boundary is simply extended to include that functionality.

=== Consistency of Security Problem Definition

The threats, OSPs and assumptions defined by this PP-Module (see the <<Security Problem Definition>>) are consistent with those defined in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> as follows:

=== Consistency of Requirements

The Biometric System (i.e. TSF in this PP-Module) is comprised of biometric capture sensors and firmware/software that provide functions described in this PP-Module TOE design. The Biometric System is invoked by the mobile device as defined in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> when user’s biometric characteristics is presented to the sensor. The Biometric System creates and stores the template or compares the features with the stored template and returns the verification outcome to the mobile device.

This PP-Module assumes that the mobile device satisfies SFRs defined in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> so that the Biometric System can work as specified in this PP-Module. This section explains which SFRs in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> are directly relevant to the Biometric System security functionality.

The following rationale identifies several SFRs from <<PP_MD_V3.3>> that are needed to support Biometric System functionality and explains why the unions of SFRs in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> and this PP-Module do not lead to a contradiction.

==== Relation among SFRs/OEs in the PP_MD_V3.3 and PP-Module
The relation between SFRs defined in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> and SFRs in this PP-Module is described below for each security functionality. *Bold SFRs* are those SFRs defined in this PP-Module for the Biometric System and _italicized SFRs_ are those defined in <<PP_MD_V3.3>> for the mobile device.

===== Password authentication
The Password Authentication Factor defined in the <<PP_MD_V3.3>> is a Non-Biometric Authentication Factor as defined in this PP-Module. Mobile device shall implement the Password Authentication Factor as required by the _FIA_UAU.5.1._ This password authentication is used as an alternative authentication mechanism when the user is rejected by the biometric verification.

This PP-Module assumes that above requirements are satisfied by the mobile device as defined in OE.Alternative.

[NOTE]
====
TODO: above text should be modified because we delete assumptions and OE. 
====

===== Invocation of the Biometric System
For any modality selected in _FIA_UAU.5.1_, the mobile device shall invoke the Biometric System to unlock the device under the condition specified in _FIA_UAU.6.2_. Mobile device shall also authenticate the user following the rule specified in _FIA_UAU.5.2_.

This PP-Module assumes that above requirements are satisfied by the mobile device as defined in OE.Authentication.

[NOTE]
====
TODO: above text should be modified because we delete assumptions and OE. 
====

The Biometric System shall implement a biometric verification mechanism that satisfies SFRs defined in this PP-Module. This means that same modality shall be selected in *FIA_MBV_EXT.1.1*, and relevant criteria and its error rate shall be specified in *FIA_MBV_EXT.1.2*. If multiple modalities are selected in _FIA_UAU.5.1_, *FIA_MBV_EXT.1* shall be iterated for each modality. The Biometric System shall also enrol all modalities selected as specified in *FIA_MBE.EXT.1*, to assure the quality of samples and templates as specified in *FIA_MBV.EXT.2* and *FIA_MBE.EXT.2*. The Biometric System may also prevent use of artificial presentation attack instruments during the biometric enrolment and verification as specified in *FIA_MBE.EXT.3* and *FIA_MBV.EXT.3*.

===== Handling the verification outcome
The mobile device shall take appropriate actions after receiving the verification outcome from the Biometric System as defined in _FIA_AFL_EXT.1_. 

_FIA_AFL_EXT.1_ defines rules regarding how the authentication factors interact in terms of unsuccessful authentication and actions mobile device shall take when number of unsuccessful authentication attempts surpass the pre-defined number. The mobile device also shall apply authentication throttling after failed biometric verification, as required by _FIA_TRT_EXT.1.1_.

This PP-Module assumes that above requirements are satisfied by the mobile device as defined in OE.Authentication.

[NOTE]
====
TODO: above text should be modified because we delete assumptions and OE. 
====

===== Protection of the Biometric System and its biometric data
The mobile device shall provide the Separate Execution Environment (e.g. restricted operational environment) so that Biometric System can work securely. This Separate Execution Environment guarantees code and data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. This Separate Execution Environment is out of scope of the Biometric System defined in this PP-Module and shall be provided by the mobile device and evaluated based on <<PP_MD_V3.3>>. However, ST author shall explain how such Separate Execution Environment is provided by the mobile device for the Biometric System, as required by <<BIOSD>>. The mobile device shall also keep secret any sensitive information regarding the biometric when the mobile device receives the verification outcome from the Biometric System, as required by _FIA_UAU.7.1_, and provide cryptographic support to encrypt or decrypt biometric data as required by _FCS class_. The mobile device shall treat source biometric data and values used in the enrolment or verification process (not the final templates) as keying material and critical security parameters according the _FCS_CKM_EXT.4.2_.

This PP-Module assumes that above requirements are satisfied by the mobile device as defined in OE.Protection.

[NOTE]
====
TODO: above text should be modified. 
====

However, the Biometric System shall use this Separate Execution Environment correctly to protect biometric data and satisfy the following requirements:

* The Biometric System shall process any plaintext biometric data (e.g. capturing biometric characteristic, creating samples, features and templates) for biometric enrolment and verification within the boundary of the Separate Execution Environment. This implies that:
** Any part of the Biometric System that processes plaintext biometric data shall be within the boundary of the Separate Execution Environment. For example, the biometric capture sensor shall be configured to be within the boundary of the Separate Execution Environment, so that only the Separate Execution Environment can access to the sensor and the data captured. Any software modules that process plaintext biometric data shall run within the boundary of the Separate Execution Environment.
** Plaintext biometric data shall never be accessible from outside the Separate Execution Environment, and any entities outside the Separate Execution Environment can only access the result of process of biometric data (e.g. success or failure of biometric verification) through the interface provided by the Biometric System.

* The Biometric System shall not transmit any plaintext biometric data outside of the Separate Execution Environment.

If the Biometric System stores any part of the biometric data outside the Separate Execution Environment, the Biometric System shall protect such data so that any entities running outside the Separate Execution Environment can not get access to any plaintext biometric data. ST author shall explain what biometric data resides outside the Separate Execution Environment as required by <<BIOSD>> and if no data resides outside the environment, requirements below is implicitly satisfied.

* The Biometric System shall not store any plaintext biometric data outside the Separate Execution Environment. As described in this PP-Module Section TOE design, the Biometric System can store templates in the enrolment database. The Biometric System shall encrypt templates using cryptographic service provided by the mobile device within the Separate Execution Environment before storing them in the database, even if the mobile device storage itself is encrypted by the mobile device.

* The Biometric System may overwrite encrypted biometric data in the storage when no longer needed. For example, the Biometric System may overwrite an encrypted template when it is revoked. This is an optional requirement.

The Biometric System shall also protect templates so that only the user of the mobile device can access them. This means that the Biometric System shall only allow authenticated user by the Password Authentication Factor to access (e.g. add or revoke) the template.

* The Biometric System shall control access to, including adding or revoking, the templates.

The above requirements are defined as *FPT_PBT_EXT.1*, *FPT_BDP_EXT.1*, *FPT_KST_EXT.1* and *FPT_KST_EXT.2* in Security Functional Requirements and *FDP_RIP.2* in Optional Requirements in this PP-Module.

===== Management of the Biometric System configuration
The mobile device shall enable/disable the BAF as required by _FMT_SMF_EXT.1 (Management function 23)_, and revoke the BAF as _FMT_SMF_EXT.1 (Management Function 46)_. Any change to the BAF (e.g. adding or revoking templates) requires re-authentication via the Password Authentication Factor as required by _FIA_UAU.6.2_.

The <<BIOPP-Module>> assumes that above requirements are satisfied by the TOE environment as defined in OE.Protection.

== Selection-Based Requirements

As indicated in the introduction to this PP-Module, the baseline requirements (those that shall be performed by the TOE) are contained in <<Security Functional Requirements>>. Additionally, there are two other types of requirements specified in <<Selection-Based Requirements>> and <<Optional Requirements>>.

This section comprises requirements based on selections in other SFRs from the PP-Module: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in this Section will need to be included in the body of the ST.

The PP-Module does not contain any selection-based requirements.

== Optional Requirements
This section comprises requirements that can be included in the ST, but are not mandatory for a TOE to claim conformance to this PP-Module.

ST authors are free to choose none, some or all SFRs defined in this Section. Just the fact that a product supports a certain functionality does not mandate to add any SFR defined in this chapter.

=== Identification and Authentication (FIA)

==== FIA_MBE_EXT.3 Presentation attack detection for biometric enrolment [[FIA_MBE_EXT.3]]

*FIA_MBE_EXT.3.1* The TSF shall prevent use of artificial presentation attack instruments from being successfully enroled.

==== FIA_MBV_EXT.3 Presentation attack detection for biometric verification [[FIA_MBV_EXT.3]]

*FIA_MBV_EXT.3.1* The TSF shall prevent use of artificial presentation attack instruments from being successfully verified.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: Artefacts that the TOE prevent and relevant criteria for its security relevant error rates for each type of artefact is defined in <<BIOSD>>.

=== User data protection (FDP)

==== FDP_RIP.2 Full residual information protection [[FDP_RIP.2]]

*FDP_RIP.2.1* The TSF shall ensure that any previous information content of biometric data is made unavailable upon the [*selection*: _allocation of the resource to, deallocation of the resource from_] all objects.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The Consistency Rationale in the appropriate PP-Configuration explains how the TOE in cooperation with its environment protects biometric data in detail.

== Extended Component Definitions
This appendix contains the definitions for the extended requirements that are used in the PP-Module, including those used in <<Optional Requirements>>. 

(Note: formatting conventions for selections and assignments in this Section are those in <<CC2>>.)

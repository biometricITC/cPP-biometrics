# Introduction 
The CCDB has established a Work Group to assist in creating an iTC (and hence cPPs) for Biometrics Security (the Work Group name is abbreviated to "BS WG")([details](https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/communities/Bio.cfm)) This repository contains all documents that are developed by the iTC. Please note that - if not noted otherwise - all documents in this repository represent work in progress.

      <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> The CCDB Working Group has been requested to develop an Essential Security Requirements
         			(ESR) for biometrics product. This initial draft contains material that was provided by
         			the initiator, IPA (Japan), for a cPP and reviewed by Working Group members (AISEP
         			(Australia), CCN (Spain) and TSE (Turkey)) and initial Biometric Security iTC members
         			(AIST (Japan), Apple (United States), Epoche &amp; Espri and Applus Laboratories
         			(Spain), Safran Identity &amp; Security (France), TUViT (Germany)) then submitted to the
         			CCDB for public review. 
      </p>
      		
      <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> Security requirements in this draft don't depend on biometric characteristics (e.g.
         			fingerprint, face and vein). Therefore the cPP that is to be developed based on this ESR
         			does not depend on biometric characteristics either. The evaluation methodology is
         			defined and described in the supporting document for each biometric characteristic if
         			necessary. 
      </p>
      <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> It is acknowledged that various PPs for biometric technology are
         			already existing by the time that this document is developed, see [BSI-CC-PP-0043-2008],
         			[BSI-CC-PP-0062-2009], [BSI-PP-0063-2009], [AIST-PP-BVPPP-2016]. However, the authors of
         			this document agree that the development of a cPP for biometrics shall solely start on
         			the basis of this Essential Security Requirements Document and under consideration of
         			the following objectives: 
      </p>
      		
      <ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
         			
         <li>The current state of the technology in biometrics in all interested countries shall
            				be considered, 
         </li>
         			
         <li>The developed cPP shall be independent of a concrete biometric modality, </li>
         			
         <li>The developed cPP shall be as modular as possible in order to cover all potential
            				application cases. 
         </li>
         		
      </ul>
      		
      <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">Accompanying supporting documents are dependent of a concrete biometric modality.
         			Currently supporting documents for fingerprint and finger/palm vein are planned to be
         			developed. CCRA certificates that claim conformance to the cPP shall be issued only for
         			modalities for which CCRA endorsed supporting documents are available.

      <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> This document describes the high-level set of security requirements that a biometric
         			product shall satisfy when evaluated against the cPP written for such technology. 
      </p>
      		
      <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> The biometric product enrols and/or verifies a user using his/her biometric
         			characteristic. Each process is described in the following paragraphs. A biometric
         			product may implement only one of those functionalities. 
      </p>
      		
      <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> a) Enrolment During the enrolment process the biometric product captures the biometric
         			raw data of a user and extracts the biometric feature it is working with. The biometric
         			feature is then combined with the identity of the user and stored as a biometric
         			template in a database.
      </p>
      		
      <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> b) Biometric verification During the verification process the user provides his/her
         			identity and biometric characteristic to the biometric product. The biometric product
         			retrieves the biometric template associated with the identity from the database,
         			compares it with the biometric feature extracted from the captured biometric
         			characteristic of the user to generate the similarity between the two data, and
         			determines whether user is accepted or rejected based on the similarity. Examples of
         			modalities used by biometric recognition systems are: fingerprint, face, iris, palm
         			print, finger vein, palm vein, speech, signature and so forth. The following figure,
         			inspired from ISO/IEC JTC1 SC37 standards, is a generic representation of a biometric
         			system (other configurations exist). This illustrates the different sub-functionalities
         			on which the biometric enrollment and the biometric verification processes rely on.

      <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> When used in a security system, the biometric product needs to take into account the
         			risk of subverting the biometric functionalities. One of the main entry points for an
         			attacker is the biometric capture subsystem where they could present artificial or
         			abnormal biometric traits at the point of presentation and collection of the relevant
         			biometric characteristics, in order to interfere with system policy. As defined in
         			[30107-1], this corresponds to a presentation attack, the &#8220;presentation to the biometric
         			data capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric
         			system&#8221;. It can be realized by presenting an artefact or human characteristic which are
         			called presentation attack instruments. Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) refers to
         			the automatic determination of a presentation attack. The PAD subsystem plays an
         			important role in the security of biometric systems, especially when unsupervised.

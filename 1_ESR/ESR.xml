	<section title="Status" id="status">
		<p> The CCDB Working Group has been requested to develop an Essential Security Requirements
			(ESR) for biometrics product. This initial draft contains material that was provided by
			the initiator, IPA (Japan), for a cPP and reviewed by Working Group members (AISEP
			(Australia), CCN (Spain) and TSE (Turkey)) and initial Biometric Security iTC members
			(AIST (Japan), Apple (United States), Epoche &amp; Espri and Applus Laboratories
			(Spain), Safran Identity &amp; Security (France), TUViT (Germany)) then submitted to the
			CCDB for public review. </p>
		<p> Security requirements in this draft don't depend on biometric characteristics (e.g.
			fingerprint, face and vein). Therefore the cPP that is to be developed based on this ESR
			does not depend on biometric characteristics either. The evaluation methodology is
			defined and described in the supporting document for each biometric characteristic if
			necessary. </p><p> It is acknowledged that various PPs for biometric technology are
			already existing by the time that this document is developed, see [BSI-CC-PP-0043-2008],
			[BSI-CC-PP-0062-2009], [BSI-PP-0063-2009], [AIST-PP-BVPPP-2016]. However, the authors of
			this document agree that the development of a cPP for biometrics shall solely start on
			the basis of this Essential Security Requirements Document and under consideration of
			the following objectives: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>The current state of the technology in biometrics in all interested countries shall
				be considered, </li>
			<li>The developed cPP shall be independent of a concrete biometric modality, </li>
			<li>The developed cPP shall be as modular as possible in order to cover all potential
				application cases. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Accompanying supporting documents are dependent of a concrete biometric modality.
			Currently supporting documents for fingerprint and finger/palm vein are planned to be
			developed. CCRA certificates that claim conformance to the cPP shall be issued only for
			modalities for which CCRA endorsed supporting documents are available. </p> References: <ul>

	<section title="Background and Purpose" id="purpose">
		<p> From ISO/IEC 2382-37 Information technology — Vocabulary — Part 37: Biometrics (cf.
			http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c055194_ISOIEC_2382-37_2012.zip),
			we have the following definitions.</p>
		<p> Biometric recognition, biometrics -- automated recognition of individuals based on their
			biological and behavioural characteristics <br/> Biometric System -- system for the
			purpose of the biometric recognition of individuals based on their behavioural and
			biological characteristics </p>
		<p> This document describes the high-level set of security requirements that a biometric
			product shall satisfy when evaluated against the cPP written for such technology. </p>
		<p> The biometric product enrols and/or verifies a user using his/her biometric
			characteristic. Each process is described in the following paragraphs. A biometric
			product may implement only one of those functionalities. </p>
		<p> a) Enrolment During the enrolment process the biometric product captures the biometric
			raw data of a user and extracts the biometric feature it is working with. The biometric
			feature is then combined with the identity of the user and stored as a biometric
			template in a database.</p>
		<p> b) Biometric verification During the verification process the user provides his/her
			identity and biometric characteristic to the biometric product. The biometric product
			retrieves the biometric template associated with the identity from the database,
			compares it with the biometric feature extracted from the captured biometric
			characteristic of the user to generate the similarity between the two data, and
			determines whether user is accepted or rejected based on the similarity. Examples of
			modalities used by biometric recognition systems are: fingerprint, face, iris, palm
			print, finger vein, palm vein, speech, signature and so forth. The following figure,
			inspired from ISO/IEC JTC1 SC37 standards, is a generic representation of a biometric
			system (other configurations exist). This illustrates the different sub-functionalities
			on which the biometric enrollment and the biometric verification processes rely on. </p>
		<img src="./images/process.jpg" alt="generic biometric system" style="width:800px;"/>
		<p> When used in a security system, the biometric product needs to take into account the
			risk of subverting the biometric functionalities. One of the main entry points for an
			attacker is the biometric capture subsystem where they could present artificial or
			abnormal biometric traits at the point of presentation and collection of the relevant
			biometric characteristics, in order to interfere with system policy. As defined in
			[30107-1], this corresponds to a presentation attack, the “presentation to the biometric
			data capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric
			system”. It can be realized by presenting an artefact or human characteristic which are
			called presentation attack instruments. Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) refers to
			the automatic determination of a presentation attack. The PAD subsystem plays an
			important role in the security of biometric systems, especially when unsupervised. </p>

	<section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
		<p>Biometric products are used for user authentication for mobile devices such as
			smartphones, PC login at offices, ATMs at banks, and building or room entrance control,
			or border security checks. The configuration of the biometric products is categorized
			into the following two types:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Integrated Type: The components of the biometric products are not physically
				separated, i.e., the components are not connected by USB cables or network. </li>
			<li> Separated Type: The components of the biometric products are physically separated,
				i.e., the components are connected by USB cables or network. </li>

				biometric features of a genuine user and make any kind of presentation attack
				instruments based on the biometric features).</li>
			<li>An attacker can present any kind of presentation attack instruments in order to
				disguise her own identity during the enrolment or verification process.</li>

Materials 
===========

Glossy photo paper (M.1)
-----------------------------
the image should cover at least the minimum of 5 x 7 inches. This could be a borderless image or printed on a larger sheet of photo paper (and cut if necessary)


Standard office paper (M.2)
----------------------------
 (Paper weight would impact print quality (for example in the US paper is usually 20lb or 24lb in office use with the higher one being better quality and hence probably better for generating a PAI))

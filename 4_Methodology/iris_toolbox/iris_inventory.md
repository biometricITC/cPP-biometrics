_**Looking at off the shelf multi-function printers you can buy for less than $200 (at Best Buy), does 300DPI or even 600DPI make sense for the scanning resolution? I can find a lot of scanners that do at least 1200 optical DPI. Printing resolution seems to also generally be 1200DPI or higher (depending on the printer). It seems to me like what we really have for scanning would be 1200DPI for Type 1 and then "professional" for Type 3 (or Type 2 if you want to leave Type 3 blank instead of Type 2), and the "professional" would be if you went to a photo printing place for whatever they use.**_

_** I'm thinking that the output screens should be defined by their DPI resolution and not their resolution/size. I do not think it matters as much that the screen is 4K and 24" as much as having a DPI that matches (i.e. if a tablet or even a phone can provide a similar DPI but needs to be a little closer, that should be acceptable as well). My thinking here is that it is the DPI that is more important and that many newer screens on tablets and phones have much higher DPI than a large monitor does, which would seem to provide a better actual image to the sensor (barring distance issues). Given that the iris is much smaller that the face, this would seem likely to work.**_

Overview
========
In this attack, 3D face mask is created by uploading target user’s frontal and profile face images to, for example, “Thats My Face” (http://thatsmyface.com/Custom-Wearable-Masks/Custom-Wearable-Mask/flypage.ilvm_grey.tpl.html) So, this attack doesn’t require user corporation to create the PAI.

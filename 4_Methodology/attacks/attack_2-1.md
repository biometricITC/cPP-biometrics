Attack type
===========
2D face, printed photo attack

Overview
========
_In this attack, normal quality of target user’s digital face image is available to attacker._

The target user takes own face image using the mobile device and publishes it on the profile page. Attacker can download this image to create PAI. This is the same testing as Normal quality testing as defined in the Evaluation Activity for FIA_BVR_EXT.4.2. Evaluator can skip or do the same test again based on the result of the Evaluation Activity.

Input
======
Digital image of target user’s face that meet the following conditions:
* captured by the mobile device camera whose resolution is 6MP and above. Evaluator shall not use the mobile device that embeds the TOE (because the TOE may be trained using images capturedby the mobile device)
* photo was taken under controlled environment where the background of the scene is uniform, the light in the office is switched on and the window blinds are down
* photo was taken right after the target user’s enrolment and under the same condition to reduce the possibility that the PAI is rejected because of the difference of the background scene or expression
* target user’s face occupies about 20% of the full image
* photo includes user’s full face

Tools
=====
- tbd
- M.1, type 1

Recipe
======
1) Attacker prints target user’s face image on the standard office paper using the printer.

Variations
==========
tbd

Prerequisite
==========
Target user turns on the face unlock and registers user’s face following instructions provided by the device and manual (i.e. target user should not wear glasses, hat, beard, or heavy make-up during the enrollment if the guidance instructs not to do so) under the controlled environment.
If the ST covers the multiple configurations for face unlock, the same test should be done for all configurations.

Presentation
============
Attacker presents the photo (i.e standard office paper) to the device by hand at controlled environment. Attacker adjusts the distance between the photo and the device seeing relevant attack video clip or attacker adjusts to right distance so that the device camera can’t see the edge of photo. Attacker also presents the photo to minimize the reflection from ambient lighting.

PAD technique
=============
Different types of image aliasing appear during the recapture of a face image that can be detected by the PAD. [Patel et al., 2015] study the PAD method that can be implemented on the mobile device.
